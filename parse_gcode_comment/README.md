### GCode comment parser


#### How to:
	- Put comment variables into `variables.txt`
	- This is case sensitive, will probably change that later


#### TODO:
	- Add makefile
	- Ensure that program does not care about case, or maybe add option for case sensitivity
	- Add ability to decide output file
